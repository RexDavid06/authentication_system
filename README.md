# my_recent_project
My first Django project as an upcoming  backend developer

I just made a project with an authentication system that allows a user sign-up and sign-in into a blog page.
And the user, when signed in, will have he's of her dashboard.
tho i haven't added the dashboadr template...the template rendering in the dashboard is a "coming soon template from bootstrap"
And all the templates i used, were gotten from bootstrapmadeit.

And i spoke about an error that i had. I just found the bug and this is the fixed version of the website.
the  mistake was that when i defined the signup function i was suppose to redirect it to the login page, but i rendered it..
